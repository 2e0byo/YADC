YADC does not currently have a CLI.

Instead, you should write your own script setting up your environment properly.

See https://github.com/2e0byo/YADC/blob/master/main.py for a template to get
you started quickly.

Writing a CLI would not be too difficult: if you write run, please contribute
it back to the project!
